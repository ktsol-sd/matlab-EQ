# matlab-EQ
(not a great) project I did in uni, very fun and can create meme songs

It's a very crappy and basic graphical equalizer made in matlab which i "translated" from java. There are probably tons of bugs but it was a uni assignment. Matlab version is R2018b and it needs Signal Processing Toolbox, Audio System Toolbox, and DSP System Toolbox to run. If for some reason someone wants to run it just save the files into a folder, open equalizer.m and run it and it should (probably) work.
