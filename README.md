# matlab-EQ
Audio EQ in matlab created as an assignment for uni

It's a basic graphical equalizer made in matlab which. There are probably some bugs. Matlab version is R2018b and it needs Signal Processing Toolbox, Audio System Toolbox, and DSP System Toolbox to run. If for some reason someone wants to run it just save the files into a folder, open equalizer.m and run it and it should (probably) work.
